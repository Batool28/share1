 ~ Sharing Economy Platform

The “Car Rental Management System” is a web-based application designed to facilitate the process of
renting cars from a single company. The primary objective of this system is to provide a platform where
a car rental company can list its vehicles available for rent, and customers can easily browse, select, and
rent these vehicles. The system aims to streamline the car rental process by providing a user-friendly
interface for both the company and its customers. The company can manage its fleet of cars, track their
availability, and handle rental transactions. On the other hand, customers can view available cars,
compare their features and prices, and contact the owner directly to rent a car. This system will
significantly enhance the efficiency of the car rental process, reduce manual work, and improve customer
satisfaction. It will also provide a transparent platform for transactions, ensuring trust and reliability
between the company and its customers. The project will be developed using PHP, JavaScript, and
HTML/CSS, considering their wide usage in web development and the user’s familiarity with these
technologies. The system will also incorporate necessary security measures to protect sensitive data and
ensure secure transactions.
